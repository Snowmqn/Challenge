# Challenge

Challenge is a simple web app requested by a potential employer. Only the Boggle portion was completed in the original time frame. Since that time I have added more to it because it seemed like a fun. 


Uses: Angular, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and localStorage. 


Boggle Initial Goal:
	Create an application that randomly generates a Boggle board and then finds all words from a specified dictionary. The difficulty comes from handling a 300000+ word dictionary and then finding all words in said dictionary. 
	I formated the dictionary into JSON and then built a trie out of it. The application searches the trie recursively to insure that all possible words are identified. 

Proposed Additions: 
	Add a 5x5 board. Allow selection between the two. Have different statistics reported for each.


Tic Tac Toe Initial Goal:
	Create an application that allows the user to play tic tac toe with a computer opponent. The user should never win.

Proposed Additions:
	The entire project. 


Proposed General Additions:
	Make the whole thing mobile friendly.
